== Situation

* The situation is critical... c'est la vie!
* For the last 3 weeks, the entire country has been on strike
** That's usually called "September"
** What's more unusual is that there are no demonstrations or demands
** Nobody's come in to work for 3 weeks, but no-one knows why, and no French citizen will explain anything beyond "Don't pretend like you don't know"

The French government has asked the Foreign Legion to figure out the reason for the unprecedented strike.

Because of the sensitivity of the request, the Foreign Legion has sent their answer to the government in a hidden way.
Yesterday, a homing pigeon with an SD card around its ankle landed at the Élysée. Since then, the French government has tried to figure out the message, to no avail. :-(

And of course, IT is on strike, so the French government needs your services, and fast!

They need your help. As a seasoned OpenShift AI user, you are their only hope...

== Mission
=== _**Difficulty Level:** Final Boss_
// * The French government has received a picture from one of its spies, as well as a tiny piece of code.
// * They are sure the picture contains a hidden message.
// * However, there is a strike at the Ministry of Defense. So no one had access to the servers ro run this code and decrypt the message hidden in the picture!

Here are the two main objectives you need to achieve in this mission:

1. Retrieve the message hidden in the picture, by any means necessary, but it has to be do-able from the French government's OpenShift AI environment.
2. Once that is done, set up a Jupyter Notebook environment that will allow the government to decrypt the message by themselves. With a huge constraint: for security reasons, they won't have access to any keyboard. So they will only be able to use the mouse to launch a Workbench, open a Notebook, and run a cell. They won't be able to modify any code, just execute it.
