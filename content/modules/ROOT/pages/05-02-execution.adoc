In the folder `lab-materials/05`, you'll find a Notebook file: `1-experiment_train_baklava.ipynb`, along with data covering the past ten years of baklava consumption across regions in Türkiye.

The notebook contains the model code with parameters ready for you to tweak and experiment with, alongside with helpful explanations, so take the time to read them carefully.

Once you've identified the best settings for your model within three experiments, deploy the best-performing one! 

Good luck, and happy experimenting!
