For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single {ocp} cluster, with {rhoai} deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

== Environment information

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log in:

* The {rhoai} Dashboard URL for our shared environment:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]
* Click on the `Login with OpenShift` button:

* Because the password is so simple (`{password}`), your browser might display a scary message such as:

* It is safe here to ignore this message when it pops up.

* After you authenticate, the result should look like:

If you got this far and saw all that, congratulations, you properly connected to the {rhoai} Dashboard Application!

We are now ready to start the {ic}.
