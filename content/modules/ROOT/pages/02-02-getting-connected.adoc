For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single {ocp} cluster, with {rhoai} deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

== Environment information

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log in:

* The {rhoai} Dashboard URL for our shared environment:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]
* Click on the `Login with OpenShift` button:

We are now ready to start the {ic}.

* In order to make your life easier, the workbench called "Mission Workbench" is already running in your project!
* And this workbench already has the git project (`https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/ai-mazing-race.git`) cloned into it.
* So, in that workbench, you will be able to find all the relevant Lab Materials
* More on that soon.
