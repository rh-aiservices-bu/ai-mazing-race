* Navigate to lab-materials/03 and open stars-classification.ipynb

* train_test_split has something wrong...
* plt.show() is used to visualize the confusion matrix

* In the Jupyter Notebook, you have the possibility to use Elyra pipelines...
* And then from the Data Science Pipelines UI you can setup pipeline schedule.
