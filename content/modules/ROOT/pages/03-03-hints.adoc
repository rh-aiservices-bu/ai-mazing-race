`git clone https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/ai-mazing-race.git`

* Create a project (stars-{user})
* small - pytorch - wb, with 5 GB of disk.
* Navigate to lab-materials/03 and open stars-classification.ipynb

* train_test_split has something wrong... maybe changing some range in the parameters?
* plt.show() is used to visualize the confusion matrix

* In the Jupyter Notebook, you have the possibility to use Elyra pipelines...
* And then from the Data Science Pipelines UI you can setup pipeline schedule.

[%collapsible]
====

* !pip install seaborn
* adjust the test_size to 0.3 from train_test_split in "Train the Model" section as the 30% of the data is used for testing
* substitute plt.show_me_the_stars with plt.show()
* From the Jupyter Notebook add a New Data Science Pipeline Editor, and drag and drop the stars-classification.ipynb file
* Run the pipeline from Elyra / Data Science Pipeline Editor
* Open the OpenShift AI dashboard, go to Data Science Pipelines and setup schedule for 24 hours
