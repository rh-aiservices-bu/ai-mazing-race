Sweden is in dire need of your help!  
The world famous company OMEA (Olle's Meatball and Eventual Arrangements, name still TBD) recently started adopting AI to set prices to the wares they sell.  
However, they soon noticed that the AI occasionally gave some items far too much discount, to the point where the items were for free or even had a negative price.  
OMEA has already built the infrastructure to make the stores dependant on this AI, so it's not as easy as just disabling it.  

Because of how big part of Swedens economy OMEA is, this is risking the financial collapse of the entire country, which would result in a dire lack of high-quality meatballs to the rest of the world.  
Help OMEA and Sweden by figuring out what goes wrong with the model and how it can be improved.
