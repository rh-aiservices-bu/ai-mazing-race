== Situation

Sweden is in dire need of your help!

* The world famous Swedish furniture company called **LUND** (Luxuriously Unique Nordic Designs) recently adopted AI to set prices for the items they sell.

* However, they soon noticed that the AI occasionally gave some items far too much discount, to the point where the items were for free or even had a negative price.

* LUND has already built the infrastructure to make the stores dependant on this AI, so it's not as easy as just disabling it.

* Because LUND accounts for about 72% of Sweden's economy, this is risking the financial collapse of the entire country. And in turn, this would also result in a worldwide shortage of high-quality meatballs, which could mean the end of human civilization on earth.

This is why the UN has decided to step in and send their best to help LUND find a swift resolution to this critical issue.

== Mission:
=== _**Difficulty Level:** Final Boss_
Help LUND, Sweden, (and the world, really) by figuring out what is wrong with the model and how it can be improved.
