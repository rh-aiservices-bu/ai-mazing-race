You can share your parameters and results with the model and ask for its suggestion for improvements :)

Each time you run the cells, your previous experiment results will disappear like baklava crumbs on a plate. If you want to revisit your results to compare, make sure to save your results to Model Registry before starting a new experiment!

Does your workbench know where your bucket is? Make sure they’re properly _connected_.

Each time you complete the Notebook, you’ve performed an experiment. To save your experiments in the Model Registry:

1. Open the OpenShift AI Dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Model Registry** from the menu on the right-hand side.
3. Click **Register Model** and fill in the mandatory fields.

To store **hyperparameters**, follow these steps:

1. Open the version you just registered.
2. Click **Add Property** to add key-value pairs.
3. You can use the following format for storing hyperparameters:

```
Epochs: 100
Batch Size: 16
Learning Rate: 0.001
Hidden Layer Units: 64
Mean Squared Error: 60133219.1447
Mean Absolute Error: 6949.6542
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 60133219.14469852
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 6949.654246425216
```

_Alternatively, you can use the Python library of Model Registry if you prefer to store them if you want 😉_

After you register three different version of the same model, you can deploy the best performing one.

To deploy use the following options:

- Model deployment name: `baklava`
- Serving runtime: `OpenVino Model Server`
- Model framework: `onnx - 1`
- Model location:

    > Select from existing data connection and pick `models`
    > Path: `models/<your-version>/baklava`

Then, if you prefer, you can use `2-baklava_request_model.ipynb` notebook to see how many kg of baklava a give region is expected to have!
