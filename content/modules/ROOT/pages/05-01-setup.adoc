// ## A Community-Driven Approach to Optimizing Baklava Demand Prediction

Did you know that Istanbul alone devours a staggering 2,000 tons of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava[baklava^] during the festive season? That's a lot of sweet treats!

However, with great treats come great responsibilities!

* Two years ago, the country produced way too much baklava for the demand
** This nearly bankrupted Türkiye, and greatly affected driving conditions as pallets of baklava had to be stored in the streets.
* Last year, in an attempt to avoid a repeat, the government massively underestimated the demand, as people rushed to stock up for 10 years. This led to massive disappointments throughout the country.
* This year, to ensure that every baklava lover gets their sweet fix, and to meet this incredible demand, a predictive AI model was built to predict the demand as accurately as possible! The country's future hangs in the balance!

== Mission
=== _**Difficulty Level:** Warming Up_

But Türkiye believes it can do better and has hired you to help!

Let's work together to ensure a successful festive season for everyone!

We invite you to join our effort to **optimize** this model further. Your task is to:

- **Experiment with Hyperparameters**: Tweak parameters like `epochs`, `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, and `hidden_layer_units` to find the optimal configuration.
- **Store Your Experiments**: Record the hyperparameters you used, the resulting model artifacts (the trained model), and evaluation metrics in Model Registry.
- **Deploy the Best Model**: Once you've identified the most performant model, deploy it to your environment from the Model Registry.
- **Optional: Test Your Model**: Use the provided notebook to make predictions and evaluate the deployed model's performance.

By making your experiments and storing your findings in **Model Registry**, you'll be part of a collaborative effort to make the most of this sweet AI challenge.
